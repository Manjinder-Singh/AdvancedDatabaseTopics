### AdvancedDatabaseTopics - COMP 8157 - Final Project

**Project Overview**
This project uses Tableau dashboards to embrace dynamic visualization in order to maximize the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Data-driven decisions are hampered by the present KPI computation method, which relies on static scripts. We offer a solution to this problem that combines dynamic KPI presentation with pertinent data and makes use of statistical methods to guarantee the accuracy of the data. The project focuses on the sales industry and provides stakeholders with an interactive platform, precise KPI computation, and thorough data pretreatment. As a result, businesses gain instantaneous insights, shorter processing times, and better data-driven decision-making.
